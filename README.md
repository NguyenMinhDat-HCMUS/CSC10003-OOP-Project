# CSC10003-OOP-Project
A program which resembles an E-commerce platform such as Tiki

In this project, I tried to write a console application which provided as many similar features to Tiki as possible. More specifically, with respect to the shop owners, they could add and remove any products from their online stores based on their business strategies. In terms of the customers' activities, these users were also capable of selecting products as well as deleting unwanted items from their digital carts. Furthermore, there was a classification system which sorted customers according to their spendings, thus rewarding them with corresponding discount offers. Besides, customers could utilize a number of discount codes when making payments.

Below is the list of OOP techniques and principles that I attempted to apply in the project:
  - Encapsulation 
  - Inheritance 
  - Function Overloading
  - Function Overriding
  - Constructor/Destructor/Constructor Chaining
